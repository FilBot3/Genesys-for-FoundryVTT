# Genesys for FoundryVTT

An attempt at implementing the Genesys Charactersheet for FoundryVTT.

The Genesys RPG is made by FantasyFlightGames.

To use this System you have to download and enable the Special Dice Roller module.

Initiative has to be manually added to the combattracker.

Check  the branches for the newest release.

Development will be slow, because of RL stuff.
